## Written Homework

Written Homework (WRH) is assigned according to the [weekly course schedule](assets/general/Spring2020/M251-Spring-2020-Schedule-addendum.pdf) (see tab at left).

For Spring 2020, starting with WRH 7, Written Homework is not to be turned in.  Successful students need to complete it by the scheduled Mondays.

Solutions are posted at the [Blackboard site](https://classes.alaska.edu/).  Note that the solutions are organized by section number.  For example, to get all of the solutions to WRH 7 you will need to look at the section 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10 solution PDFs.
