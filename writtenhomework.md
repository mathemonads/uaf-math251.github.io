## Written Homework

Written Homework (WRH) is due according to the [weekly course schedule](assets/general/Fall2019/MATH251-Schedule-F2019.pdf) (see tab at left), usually but not always on Mondays.  Written Homework is always due at the start of class.  After it is collected, the solutions will be posted at the [Blackboard site](https://classes.alaska.edu/).
