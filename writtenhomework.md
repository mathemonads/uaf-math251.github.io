## Written Homework

Written homework is usually due every Monday according to the schedule below.  (Or see the Schedule tab at left.)  We reserve the right to make minor adjustments to the assigned problems, but any changes will be announced at least one week before the assignment is due.  After the written homework is collected, the solutions will be posted at the [Blackboard site](https://classes.alaska.edu/).
