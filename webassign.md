## WebAssign

To start using WebAssign, you will need two codes:

1. Our Class Key: **uaf 1299 0905**

2. Your personal WebAssign access code.  Texts purchased from the UAF  bookstore include one; otherwise, a code can be purchased from WebAssign directly.

Note WebAssign can be used for two weeks in a "trial" period which ends Sunday September 8 2019.  You can take advantage of this period if you are uncertain about you placement in this class.
