## WebAssign

To start using WebAssign, you will need two codes:

1. Our course code: **uaf 7840 393**

2. Your personal WebAssign access code.  Texts purchased from the UAF  bookstore include one; otherwise, a code can be purchased from WebAssign directly. WebAssign can be used for two weeks in a "trial" period, which you can take advantage of if you are uncertain about
you placement in this class.
