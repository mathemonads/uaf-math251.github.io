### ALL DATES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE (OR WRONG)

Welcome to the central homepage for all in-person sections of Calculus I in **Fall 2019**.  We are in the [Dept. of Mathematics and Statistics](http://www.uaf.edu/dms/) at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](http://www.uaf.edu/).

### Getting Started

* See the [Week 1](week1) menu item to get started with the ALEKS PPL (placement, preparation, and learning) test.  You need to log in to ALEKS by Tuesday, August 27.  You will need to either complete 10 hours or 90% of your pie in ALEKS PPL's learning mode by the end of the day of Monday, January 21.

* Go to [the doodle poll](https://doodle.com/poll/cr28umftgm2be6f5) to choose a two-hour block for the proctored ALEKS assessment (= Quiz 1) on Tuesday 1/22.  The blocks are 10am-12, 12-2pm, 2-4pm, and 4-6pm; you can only choose one and space is limited.

### Keeping up to date

* See the [schedule](assets/general/Spring2019/MATH251-Schedule.pdf).  Go there often to find out what happens next.

* You should already be signed up with [WebAssign](https://webassign.net/).  Make a little progress with those problems as often as you can, and don't lose track of when they are due.

* Check what problems are on the next [Written Homework](writtenhomework), and when it is due.

* See the [schedule](assets/general/Spring2019/MATH251-Schedule.pdf) for when the next assessment will happen.  Find examples of previous assessments at the [Quizzes](quizzes), [Proficiencies](proficiencies), and [Exams](exams) tabs at left.

* Course communication (e.g announcements!) uses [Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math251/home).  You should already be [signed up on Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math251).  <!-- Start by [signing up with Piazza](https://piazza.com/uaf/spring2019/math251). -->
