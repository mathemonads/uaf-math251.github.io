## Week 1 Logistics

The first homework and quiz of the class use the online software ALEKS PPL to help you review past prerequisite skills.  You need to accomplish the following steps.

1. By Tuesday, January 15, log into ALEKS PPL **using the 
   instructions below**.  This is a different process from the 
   UAF ALEKS placement test you may have used in the past.

2. Take an initial assessment in ALEKS PPL by Wednesday, January 16 at 11:59pm.  This
   assessment will be used to determine the skills you need to practice.

3. Using ALEKS PPL's learning mode, either complete 90% of your pie, or spend
   10 hours in it reviewing.  You have until Monday, January 21 at 11:59pm to finish this task, which will count as your first homework grade.

4. Schedule a two-hour timeslot to take Quiz 1 on Tuesday, January 22.

## How to first log into ALEKS PPL.

1. You will need two codes before you begin
	* The course code, **YKTTR-MYFNJ**.
	* Your personal ALEKS access code, which you can access
	  from within BlackBoard.  Go to our course and then `My Grades`.  Your
	  ALEKS access code will be the first entry in the grade spreadsheet.

2. Go to [ALEKS](https://www.aleks.com) and click on the yellow new
   student button.

   <div class='x-scroll'><p><img src="assets/ALEKS/login.png" alt="login" width="350px" /></p></div>

3. Enter the class code **YKTTR-MYFNJ** in the next screen.

   <div class='x-scroll'><p><img src="assets/ALEKS/classcode.png" alt="class code" width="350px" /></p></div>

4. After confirming that you are enrolling in our cohort (class), you will be asked if you already have an ALEKS login name or not.  If you do, and you remember its password, you are welcome to use it.  Otherwise, proceed as a new user.

5. In the following Registration page you will be asked for student information at this point. It is essential that you enter your UAF student ID correctly on this page; this is how we will identify your score and give you credit for your work.

6. In the following Apply Access page, enter the individual ALEKS access code you got from Blackboard.

## Working with ALEKS PPL

Now that you have logged in to ALEKS PPL, it will give you a tutorial on how to use the interface.  When you are done with that tutorial, you will start your Initial Assessment.  This can take up to two hours, and is used to determine your skills and select appropriate problems for you to work on in the future.  When your assessment is done, you'll receive a score between 0 and 100.

After your assessment is complete, you'll want to start working with the Prep and Learning Module.

You'll need to either spend at least 10 hours using the learning module, or complete 90% of your pie.  You can see your progress by clicking on Reports in the menu at the upper left-hand corner of the learning module screen.
